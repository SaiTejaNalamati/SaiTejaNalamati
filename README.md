### 🧠 About Me
👋Hi there! I’m Sai Teja, an Automation Engineer / SDET with 4+ years of experience building robust automation frameworks and testing scalable applications across healthcare, travel, and banking domains. I work extensively with Playwright, Selenium, Rest-Assured, Java, and TypeScript, with strong expertise in UI/API automation, microservices validation, backend data testing, and end-to-end quality engineering.

I’ve designed and implemented automation architectures from the ground up, migrated large legacy suites to modern frameworks, and integrated testing into CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. My work spans UI, API, mobile, and performance testing bringing together best practices, maintainable code, and automation-first testing strategies.

I’m passionate about improving release efficiency, strengthening automation coverage, and creating scalable solutions that help teams deliver high-quality releases consistently. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, solving complex quality challenges, and staying up to date with evolving test automation tools and platforms.

Always open to explore SDET opportunities feel free to reach out!
